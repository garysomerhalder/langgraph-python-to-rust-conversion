# LangGraph Rust

A Rust implementation of LangGraph for building stateful, multi-agent applications.

## Overview

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). This Rust implementation provides a type-safe, performant alternative to the Python version, leveraging Rust's ownership system and async capabilities.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- ðŸ”’ **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees with Rust's type system
- âš¡ **Async/Await**: Built on Tokio for efficient async execution
- ðŸ“Š **Graph-Based Workflows**: Define complex agent interactions as directed graphs
- ðŸ’¾ **State Management**: Built-in state persistence and checkpointing
- ðŸ”§ **Extensible**: Easy to add custom nodes, edges, and state types

## Requirements

- Rust 1.75.0 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
