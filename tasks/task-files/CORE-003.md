# CORE-003: Implement Execution Engine

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID**: CORE-003  
**Title**: Implement Execution Engine  
**Status**: ✅ DONE  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Category**: Core  
**Created**: 2025-09-15

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement graph execution engine for running workflows
- Create async execution runtime with tokio
- Implement node execution with error handling
- Add support for parallel node execution
- Create execution context and message passing
- Implement execution streaming and monitoring

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ExecutionEngine struct with async runtime
- [x] Node execution with proper error handling
- [x] Message passing between nodes
- [x] Parallel execution support for parallel edges
- [x] Execution context with state management
- [x] Stream-based execution for real-time updates
- [x] Execution history and tracing
- [x] All tests passing for execution engine

## 🔄 Dependencies
