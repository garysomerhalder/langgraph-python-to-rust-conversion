# CORE-003: Implement Execution Engine

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID**: CORE-003  
**Title**: Implement Execution Engine  
**Status**: 🟡 IN_PROGRESS  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Category**: Core  
**Created**: 2025-09-15

- Implement execution streaming and monitoring

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ExecutionEngine struct with async runtime
- [ ] Node execution with proper error handling
- [ ] Message passing between nodes
- [ ] Parallel execution support for parallel edges
- [ ] Execution context with state management
- [ ] Stream-based execution for real-time updates
- [ ] Execution history and tracing
