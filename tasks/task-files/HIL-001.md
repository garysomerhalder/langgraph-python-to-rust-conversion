# HIL-001: Core interrupt/approve mechanism

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** HIL-001
**Title:** Core interrupt/approve mechanism
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Category:** Human-in-the-Loop
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Critical Features
**Completed:** 2025-09-26

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
**THIS TASK WAS MARKED COMPLETE BUT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN**
- Tests have 38 compilation errors
- Implementation is incomplete with stub methods
- Trait implementations don't match signatures
- Referenced types don't exist

## 🎯 Objective
~~Implement~~ **COMPLETELY REDO** the core interrupt and approval mechanism that allows human intervention during graph execution, matching Python LangGraph's `interrupt()` and `approve()` functionality.

## 📝 Description
The interrupt/approve mechanism is fundamental to human-in-the-loop workflows. It allows:
- Pausing execution at specific nodes
- Human review of current state
- Approval or modification before continuing
- Rejection with alternative paths

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execution can be interrupted at specified nodes
- [ ] State is preserved during interruption
- [ ] Human can inspect full state during pause
- [ ] Human can approve continuation
- [ ] Human can reject and specify alternative
- [ ] Async-safe interruption mechanism
- [ ] Thread-safe state preservation
- [ ] Integration with existing ExecutionEngine
- [ ] Comprehensive tests with real interruptions

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components to Implement
```rust
// src/engine/human_in_loop.rs
pub trait HumanInLoop: Send + Sync {
    async fn interrupt(&self, node: &str, state: &StateData) -> InterruptHandle;
    async fn approve(&self, handle: InterruptHandle) -> Result<ApprovalDecision>;
    async fn reject(&self, handle: InterruptHandle, reason: &str) -> Result<()>;
    async fn modify_state(&self, handle: InterruptHandle, changes: StateData) -> Result<()>;
}

pub struct InterruptHandle {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub node_id: String,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub state_snapshot: StateData,
    pub timeout: Option<Duration>,
}

pub enum ApprovalDecision {
    Continue,
    Retry,
    Skip,
    Abort(String),
    Redirect(String), // to different node
}

pub struct InterruptManager {
    pending: DashMap<Uuid, InterruptHandle>,
    callbacks: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, InterruptCallback>>>,
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **GraphBuilder** - Add `interrupt_before()` and `interrupt_after()` methods
2. **ExecutionEngine** - Check for interrupts before/after node execution  
3. **StateManager** - Snapshot and restore state during interrupts
4. **StreamingExecution** - Emit interrupt events to stream

### Python API Compatibility
```python
# Python LangGraph
graph.add_node("review", review_fn, interrupt_before=True)
result = graph.invoke(input, config={"callbacks": [approval_callback]})
```

```rust
// Rust equivalent
graph.add_node_with_interrupt("review", review_fn, InterruptMode::Before);
let result = graph.execute_with_callbacks(input, vec![approval_callback]).await?;
```

## 🚦 Implementation Plan (Traffic-Light)

### 🔴 RED Phase - Tests First (Day 1)
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_interrupt_before_node() {
    let graph = create_test_graph_with_interrupt();
    let handle = graph.execute_async(input).await;
    
    // Should pause at interrupt
    assert!(handle.is_interrupted());
    
    // Approve continuation
    handle.approve(ApprovalDecision::Continue).await?;
    
    // Should complete
    let result = handle.await?;
    assert!(result.completed);
}
```

### 🟡 YELLOW Phase - Minimal Implementation (Day 2)
- Basic interrupt mechanism
- Simple approval flow
- State preservation
- Integration with executor

### 🟢 GREEN Phase - Production Ready (Day 3)
- Timeout handling
- State modification during interrupt
- Multiple interrupt points
- Callback system
- Error recovery
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Zero blocking during interrupts
- < 10ms interrupt response time
- State consistency maintained
- All Python test cases passing

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Existing ExecutionEngine
- StateManager for snapshots
- Async runtime (tokio)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Deadlocks during interrupt | Use timeout-based recovery |
| State corruption | Immutable snapshots |
| Memory leaks | Automatic cleanup of old handles |
