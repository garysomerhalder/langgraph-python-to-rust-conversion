## üìã Task Overview
**ID:** VIZ-004
**Title:** Performance profiler for workflow optimization
**Status:** üî¥ TODO
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Category:** Visualization
**Estimated Days:** 4
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## üéØ Objective

## üìù Description
Performance profiler enables:
- Detailed execution timing analysis
- Memory usage profiling and leak detection
- CPU utilization tracking per node
- Resource contention identification
- Performance regression detection
- Optimization recommendations
- Comparative performance analysis across runs

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time performance metrics collection
- [ ] CPU and memory profiling with detailed breakdowns
- [ ] Execution timing analysis with flame graphs
- [ ] Resource contention and bottleneck identification
- [ ] Performance regression detection and alerting
- [ ] Optimization suggestions and recommendations
- [ ] Comparative analysis tools for multiple runs
- [ ] Performance report generation and export

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/visualization/profiler.rs
pub struct PerformanceProfiler {
    metrics_collector: MetricsCollector,
    analyzer: PerformanceAnalyzer,
    reporter: ProfileReporter,
    comparator: RunComparator,
}

pub struct PerformanceMetrics {
    execution_times: HashMap<String, Duration>,
    memory_usage: MemoryProfile,
    cpu_utilization: CpuProfile,
    resource_contention: ContentionData,
    custom_metrics: HashMap<String, MetricValue>,
}

pub struct PerformanceAnalysis {
    bottlenecks: Vec<Bottleneck>,
    recommendations: Vec<OptimizationRecommendation>,
    regression_alerts: Vec<RegressionAlert>,
    efficiency_score: f64,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Metrics Collection**
   - High-precision timing measurements
   - Memory allocation tracking
   - CPU usage per node/operation
   - Custom metric collection APIs

2. **Analysis Engine**
   - Bottleneck detection algorithms
   - Performance pattern recognition
   - Anomaly detection and alerting
   - Trend analysis across executions

3. **Visualization Components**
   - Flame graphs for execution analysis
   - Memory usage charts and histograms
   - Performance timeline visualization
   - Heatmaps for resource utilization

4. **Reporting System**
   - Automated performance reports
   - Comparative analysis dashboards
   - Performance budget tracking
   - CI/CD integration for regression detection

## üìä Implementation Plan
1. üî¥ **RED Phase**: Write tests for metrics collection and basic analysis
2. üü° **YELLOW Phase**: Core profiling and basic visualization
3. üü¢ **GREEN Phase**: Advanced analysis, reporting, and optimization features

## üîó Dependencies
- Depends on: ExecutionEngine instrumentation
- Related to: VIZ-002 (Execution trace viewer)
- Related to: VIZ-005 (Real-time monitoring)
- Integration with existing metrics systems

## üìù Notes
