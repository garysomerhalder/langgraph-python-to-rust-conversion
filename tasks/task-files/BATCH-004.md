# BATCH-004: Batch Error Handling

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** BATCH-004
**Title:** Comprehensive batch error handling and recovery
**Status:** ✅ DONE
**Started:** 2025-09-27
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Batch Processing
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for batch processing that ensure reliable execution, proper error reporting, and intelligent retry strategies.

## 📝 Description
Batch error handling enables:
- Comprehensive error classification and handling
- Intelligent retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing dependencies
- Batch-level rollback and compensation
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Recovery mechanisms for partial failures

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Error classification system (transient, permanent, fatal)
- [x] Configurable retry strategies with backoff
- [x] Dead letter queue for persistently failing jobs
- [x] Circuit breaker integration for external dependencies
- [x] Batch-level transaction and rollback support
- [x] Error aggregation and detailed reporting
- [x] Recovery mechanisms and job resurrection
- [x] Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/error_handling.rs
pub struct BatchErrorHandler {
    retry_strategy: RetryStrategy,
    dead_letter_queue: DeadLetterQueue,
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreaker,
    error_reporter: ErrorReporter,
}

pub enum ErrorType {
    Transient(TransientError),    // Retry immediately
    Recoverable(RecoverableError), // Retry with backoff
    Permanent(PermanentError),     // Move to DLQ
    Fatal(FatalError),            // Fail entire batch
}

pub struct RetryStrategy {
    max_attempts: u32,
    backoff_strategy: BackoffStrategy,
    jitter: bool,
    retry_predicates: Vec<RetryPredicate>,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Error Classification**
   - Automatic error type detection
   - Custom error classification rules
   - Context-aware error categorization

2. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Per-error-type retry policies
   - Conditional retry predicates

3. **Circuit Breaking**
   - Dependency health monitoring
   - Automatic circuit opening/closing
   - Fallback mechanisms for broken circuits

4. **Dead Letter Queue**
   - Persistent storage for failed jobs
   - Job inspection and analysis tools
   - Manual retry and recovery options

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. ✅ **RED Phase**: Write tests for various error scenarios - COMPLETE
2. ✅ **YELLOW Phase**: Basic retry and DLQ implementation - COMPLETE
3. ✅ **GREEN Phase**: Advanced circuit breaking and recovery - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Implementation Summary
- Comprehensive BatchErrorHandler with all error classification types
- DeadLetterQueue with in-memory and pluggable storage backends
- CircuitBreaker with three states (Closed, Open, HalfOpen)
- ErrorReporter with aggregation and trend analysis
- 3 Recovery strategies (SimpleRetry, ExponentialBackoff, DataCleanup)
- 3 Alert handlers (Email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Full process_batch_with_handling method for production use

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: BATCH-001 (Batch execution API)
- Depends on: BATCH-002 (Parallel processing)
- Related to: Checkpointer backends for error state persistence
- Related to: Resilience patterns from ExecutionEngine

## 📝 Notes
- Integrate with existing resilience patterns in the codebase
- Use structured logging for error analysis
- Consider implementing error budgets for SLA management
- Support custom error handlers for domain-specific logic
