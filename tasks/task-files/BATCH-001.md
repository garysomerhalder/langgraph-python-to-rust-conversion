# BATCH-001: Batch Execution API

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** BATCH-001
**Title:** Batch execution API for processing multiple workflows
**Status:** 🔴 TODO
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Batch Processing
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive batch execution API that allows processing multiple workflows efficiently with proper resource management, monitoring, and error handling.

## 📝 Description
Batch execution enables:
- Processing multiple workflows in parallel
- Efficient resource utilization across batches
- Progress tracking and monitoring
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Result collection and aggregation
- Batch-level error handling and retry logic

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BatchExecutor struct with configurable concurrency
- [ ] Async batch processing with tokio runtime
- [ ] Progress tracking and monitoring hooks
- [ ] Resource management and backpressure handling
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Result collection and aggregation utilities
- [ ] Integration with existing execution engine
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/executor.rs
pub struct BatchExecutor {
    concurrency_limit: usize,
    max_retries: u32,
    timeout_duration: Duration,
    progress_callback: Option<ProgressCallback>,
}

pub struct BatchJob {
    pub id: String,
    pub graph: CompiledGraph,
    pub input: StateData,
    pub priority: u8,
}

pub struct BatchResult {
    pub job_id: String,
    pub status: BatchJobStatus,
    pub output: Option<StateData>,
    pub error: Option<String>,
    pub duration: Duration,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Concurrency Control**
   - Semaphore-based limiting
   - Priority queue for job scheduling
   - Dynamic scaling based on load

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time progress callbacks
   - Batch completion statistics
   - Individual job status tracking

3. **Error Handling**
   - Per-job retry logic
   - Batch-level failure strategies
   - Error aggregation and reporting

4. **Resource Management**
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - CPU throttling capabilities
   - Graceful shutdown handling

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for batch execution
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Minimal batch executor implementation
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Production hardening with monitoring

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: ExecutionEngine (COMPLETE)
- Related to: BATCH-002 (Parallel processing)
- Related to: BATCH-003 (Result aggregation)

## 📝 Notes
- Use Integration-First methodology - test against real workflows
- Ensure compatibility with existing checkpointer backends
- Consider using channels for result streaming
- Implement proper graceful shutdown for long-running batches
