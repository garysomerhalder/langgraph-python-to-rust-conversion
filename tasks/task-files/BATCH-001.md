**Title:** Batch execution API for processing multiple workflows
**Status:** 🟡 COMPLETE - YELLOW PHASE (Core Functionality Working)
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Batch Processing
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features
**Started:** 2025-09-27 16:35:00 UTC
**Yellow Complete:** 2025-09-27 17:15:00 UTC

## 🎯 Objective

- [x] Progress tracking and monitoring hooks ✅ YELLOW
- [x] Resource management and backpressure handling ✅ YELLOW
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic ✅ YELLOW
- [x] Result collection and aggregation utilities ✅ YELLOW
- [x] Integration with existing execution engine ✅ YELLOW
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization (GREEN phase)

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/executor.rs
pub struct BatchExecutor {
    concurrency_limit: usize,
    max_retries: u32,
    timeout_duration: Duration,
    progress_callback: Option<ProgressCallback>,
}

pub struct BatchJob {
    pub id: String,
    pub graph: CompiledGraph,
    pub input: StateData,
    pub priority: u8,
}

pub struct BatchResult {
    pub job_id: String,
    pub status: BatchJobStatus,
    pub output: Option<StateData>,
    pub error: Option<String>,
    pub duration: Duration,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Concurrency Control**
   - Semaphore-based limiting
   - Priority queue for job scheduling
   - Dynamic scaling based on load

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time progress callbacks
   - Batch completion statistics
   - Individual job status tracking

3. **Error Handling**
   - Per-job retry logic
   - Batch-level failure strategies
   - Error aggregation and reporting

4. **Resource Management**
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - CPU throttling capabilities
   - Graceful shutdown handling

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for batch execution ✅ COMPLETE
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Minimal batch executor implementation ✅ COMPLETE
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Production hardening with monitoring 🔄 READY

## 🎯 YELLOW Phase Summary (COMPLETE)
**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Created `BatchExecutor` with Semaphore-based concurrency control
- ✅ Implemented async batch processing using tokio channels and tasks
- ✅ Added comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff and timeout handling
- ✅ Built progress callback system for real-time monitoring
- ✅ Created `BatchResult` collection and statistics calculation
- ✅ Integrated with existing `ExecutionEngine` using real graph execution
- ✅ Added 5 comprehensive integration tests (all passing)

**Key Features Working:**
- Configurable concurrency limits (default: 10 concurrent jobs)
- Job prioritization and scheduling
- Individual job retry with configurable max attempts (default: 3)
- Timeout handling per job (default: 5 minutes)
- Progress tracking with completion/failure counters
- Graceful handling of empty batches
- Full integration with CompiledGraph execution

**Test Coverage:**
- Single job execution
- Multiple job batching (5 jobs with concurrency limit 3)
- Concurrency limit enforcement (2 concurrent max)
- Empty batch handling
- Statistics calculation

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: ExecutionEngine (COMPLETE)
- Related to: BATCH-002 (Parallel processing)
- Related to: BATCH-003 (Result aggregation)

## 📝 Notes
- Use Integration-First methodology - test against real workflows
- Ensure compatibility with existing checkpointer backends
- Consider using channels for result streaming
- Implement proper graceful shutdown for long-running batches
