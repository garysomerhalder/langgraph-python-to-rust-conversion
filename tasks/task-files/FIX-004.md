# FIX-004: Fix ResumptionManager Stub Implementations

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** FIX-004
**Title:** Replace ResumptionManager stubs with real implementations
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Priority:** P0 (Blocking tests)
**Category:** Critical Fixes
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Emergency Fixes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
**RESUMPTIONMANAGER IS FULL OF STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS**
- Most methods just store data and return Ok(())
- No actual resumption logic implemented
- Tests fail because nothing actually works

## 🎯 Objective
Replace ALL stub implementations in ResumptionManager with actual working code.

## 📝 Current Stub Disasters

### Examples of Fake Implementations
```rust
// Current "implementation" - FAKE
pub async fn resume_workflow(
    &self,
    snapshot_id: &Uuid,
    engine: &ExecutionEngine,
    graph: Arc<CompiledGraph>,
) -> Result<StateData> {
    // Just returns snapshot state, doesn't actually resume
    let snapshot = self.load_snapshot(snapshot_id).await
        .ok_or_else(|| LangGraphError::Execution("Snapshot not found".to_string()))?;
    Ok(snapshot.state)  // THIS DOESN'T RESUME ANYTHING
}

// Current "implementation" - FAKE
pub async fn resume_from_node(
    &self,
    graph: Arc<CompiledGraph>,
    state: StateData,
    node_id: &str,
) -> Result<StateData> {
    // Comment says "just run the full execution"
    // This COMPLETELY IGNORES node_id parameter!
    self.run_execution(&execution_id).await
}
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] resume_workflow actually resumes workflow from snapshot
- [ ] resume_from_node starts from specified node
- [ ] save_resumption_point creates valid resumption points
- [ ] get_resumption_history returns real history
- [ ] cleanup_old_snapshots actually cleans up
- [ ] No methods just return dummy data

## 🔧 Required Real Implementations

### Fix resume_workflow
```rust
pub async fn resume_workflow(
    &self,
    snapshot_id: &Uuid,
    engine: &ExecutionEngine,
    graph: Arc<CompiledGraph>,
) -> Result<StateData> {
    // 1. Load snapshot
    // 2. Restore execution state to engine
    // 3. Continue execution from saved point
    // 4. Return final state after resumed execution
    // NOT just return snapshot.state
}
```

### Fix save_resumption_point
```rust
pub async fn save_resumption_point(
    &self,
    execution_id: &Uuid,
    node_id: &str,
    engine: &ExecutionEngine,
) -> Result<WorkflowSnapshot> {
    // 1. Get current execution state from engine
    // 2. Create snapshot with execution context
    // 3. Store node traversal history
    // 4. Save resumable state
    // NOT just create empty snapshot
}
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't keep "// TODO: Implement actual logic" comments
- Don't just store and retrieve data without processing
- Don't ignore critical parameters
- Don't return success when nothing was done

## 📊 Methods Needing Real Implementation
1. save_resumption_point
2. resume_workflow
3. resume_from_node
4. resume_with_modified_state
5. resume_multiple
6. save_error_state
7. get_resumption_history (with actual filtering)

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- All methods perform their advertised function
- No stub returns or dummy data
- Resumption actually resumes execution
- State modifications actually modify state
- Tests using ResumptionManager can pass (not just compile)

## 🔥 Why This is Critical
The entire HIL-005 task (Workflow Resumption) is built on this broken foundation. It's marked as "IN_PROGRESS" but the core component is completely fake. This blocks all workflow resumption features.

## 📝 Notes
Classic YELLOW phase failure - added just enough code to make it compile, but not enough to make it work. This is why Traffic-Light Development requires REAL implementations, not stubs.
