- [ ] **Backup compression** - Efficient storage utilization
- [ ] **Automated backup scheduling** - Cron-like backup triggers
- [ ] **Backup monitoring** - Health checks and alerting
- [ ] **Multi-region backup replication** - Geographic redundancy
- [ ] **Point-in-time recovery** - Granular recovery options

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **BackupManager** - Central backup orchestration
2. **BackupStrategy** - Different backup approaches (full, incremental, differential)
3. **BackupStorage** - Storage backends (local, S3, GCS, Azure)
4. **BackupCatalog** - Metadata and backup inventory
5. **RestoreManager** - Recovery operations and validation
6. **RetentionPolicy** - Automated backup lifecycle management

### Backup Types
- **Full Backup** - Complete checkpoint state snapshot
- **Incremental Backup** - Changes since last backup
- **Differential Backup** - Changes since last full backup
- **Log-based Backup** - Transaction log backup for point-in-time recovery

### Storage Integration
```rust
// Multi-backend backup support
trait BackupStorage {
    async fn store_backup(&self, backup: &Backup) -> Result<BackupId>;
    async fn retrieve_backup(&self, id: &BackupId) -> Result<Backup>;
    async fn list_backups(&self, filter: BackupFilter) -> Result<Vec<BackupMetadata>>;
    async fn delete_backup(&self, id: &BackupId) -> Result<()>;
}

// Cross-backend recovery
trait CrossBackendRestore {
    async fn restore_to_backend(&self, backup: &Backup, target: &dyn Checkpointer) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Backup Infrastructure
1. Define BackupManager trait and basic implementations
2. Implement file-based backup storage
3. Create backup metadata schema and catalog
4. Add basic full backup functionality

### Phase 2: Advanced Backup Features
1. Implement incremental and differential backup strategies
2. Add backup compression and encryption
3. Integrate with cloud storage backends
4. Implement automated backup scheduling

### Phase 3: Disaster Recovery
1. Cross-backend restore capabilities
2. Multi-region backup replication
3. Point-in-time recovery with granular control
4. Automated disaster recovery workflows

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-End Recovery** - Complete backup and restore cycles
- **Cross-Backend Compatibility** - Restore across different persistence backends
- **Performance Testing** - Backup speed and storage efficiency
- **Failure Simulation** - Test recovery under various failure scenarios
- **Data Integrity** - Verify restored data matches original state

### Test Scenarios
1. **Single Backend Backup/Restore** - Memory, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3
2. **Cross-Backend Migration** - Backup from PostgreSQL, restore to S3
3. **Incremental Backup Chains** - Multiple incremental backups and restore
4. **Disaster Recovery** - Complete system failure and recovery
5. **Backup Corruption Handling** - Recovery from corrupted backups
6. **Large Dataset Handling** - Performance with significant state data

## 🚦 Success Metrics
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** - < 5 minutes for typical workloads
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** - < 1 minute data loss maximum
- **Backup Compression Ratio** - > 70% space savings
- **Cross-Backend Compatibility** - 100% successful migrations
- **Automated Backup Success Rate** - > 99.9% reliability

## 📚 Dependencies
- **PERSIST-001**: PostgreSQL backend ✅ (Required for PostgreSQL backup testing)
- **PERSIST-002**: Redis backend ✅ (Required for Redis backup testing)
- **PERSIST-003**: S3/Cloud storage backend ✅ (Required for cloud backup storage)
- **PERSIST-004**: Distributed state sync ✅ (Required for distributed backup coordination)

- Ensure backup operations don't impact live checkpoint performance
- Design for horizontal scaling of backup operations
- Consider regulatory compliance requirements (data retention, encryption)
- Plan for migration scenarios between different LangGraph versions
