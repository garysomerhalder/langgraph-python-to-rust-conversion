# HIL-005: Workflow Resumption

## Status: 🔴 RED (failing tests written)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive workflow resumption capabilities to handle interrupts, failures, and partial executions.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Suspension Points**
   - Save execution state at any node
   - Create resumption snapshots
   - Track partial results
   - Preserve execution context

2. **Resumption Management**
   - Resume from saved snapshots
   - Resume with modified state
   - Resume from specific nodes
   - Handle multiple resumption points

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Save error states
   - Resume after error fixes
   - Retry failed nodes
   - Alternative path execution

4. **Partial Results**
   - Track completed nodes
   - Preserve intermediate outputs
   - Aggregate partial results
   - Skip completed work on resume

5. **Integration**
   - Checkpointer integration
   - Interrupt system compatibility
   - State inspector support
   - Concurrent resumption handling

## Implementation Progress

### RED Phase ✅
- [x] Write comprehensive failing tests
- [x] Define ResumptionManager interface
- [x] Define WorkflowSnapshot structure
- [x] Define ResumptionPoint types
- [x] Test all resumption scenarios

### YELLOW Phase 🔴
- [ ] Implement ResumptionManager
- [ ] Implement WorkflowSnapshot
- [ ] Basic suspension/resumption
- [ ] Simple state preservation
- [ ] Minimal error handling

### GREEN Phase 🔴
- [ ] Add checkpoint integration
- [ ] Implement partial results
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Optimize for performance
- [ ] Full ExecutionEngine integration

## Test Coverage
- test_basic_resumption - Basic suspend and resume functionality
- test_resumption_with_modification - Resume with state changes
- test_multiple_resumption_points - Multiple suspension points
- test_checkpointer_integration - Integration with checkpoint system
- test_error_recovery - Recovery from execution errors
- test_partial_results - Handling partial execution results
- test_resumption_history - History tracking and analytics
- test_concurrent_resumption - Thread-safe concurrent operations
- test_resumption_cleanup - Maintenance and cleanup operations

## Notes
- Must work seamlessly with interrupt system (HIL-001)
- Should integrate with breakpoint system (HIL-002)
- Compatible with state inspection (HIL-003)
- Support feedback-driven resumption (HIL-004)
- Consider long-running workflow requirements
