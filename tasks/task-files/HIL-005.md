# HIL-005: Workflow Resumption

## Status: ðŸŸ¡ IN_PROGRESS (YELLOW phase implementation)

## Overview
Implement comprehensive workflow resumption capabilities to handle interrupts, failures, and partial executions.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Suspension Points**
   - Save execution state at any node
   - Create resumption snapshots
   - Track partial results
   - Preserve execution context

2. **Resumption Management**
   - Resume from saved snapshots
   - Resume with modified state
   - Resume from specific nodes
   - Handle multiple resumption points

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Save error states
   - Resume after error fixes
   - Retry failed nodes
   - Alternative path execution

4. **Partial Results**
   - Track completed nodes
   - Preserve intermediate outputs
   - Aggregate partial results
   - Skip completed work on resume

5. **Integration**
   - Checkpointer integration
   - Interrupt system compatibility
   - State inspector support
   - Concurrent resumption handling

## Implementation Progress

### RED Phase âœ…
- [x] Write comprehensive failing tests
- [x] Define ResumptionManager interface
- [x] Define WorkflowSnapshot structure
- [x] Define ResumptionPoint types
- [x] Test all resumption scenarios

### YELLOW Phase ðŸŸ¡ (In Progress)
- [x] Implement ResumptionManager
- [x] Implement WorkflowSnapshot
- [x] Basic suspension/resumption (execute_until, resume_from)
- [x] Simple state preservation
- [ ] Minimal error handling (partial)

### GREEN Phase ðŸ”´
- [ ] Add checkpoint integration
- [ ] Implement partial results
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Optimize for performance
- [ ] Full ExecutionEngine integration

## Test Coverage
- test_basic_resumption - Basic suspend and resume functionality
- test_resumption_with_modification - Resume with state changes
- test_multiple_resumption_points - Multiple suspension points
- test_checkpointer_integration - Integration with checkpoint system
- test_error_recovery - Recovery from execution errors
- test_partial_results - Handling partial execution results
- test_resumption_history - History tracking and analytics
- test_concurrent_resumption - Thread-safe concurrent operations
- test_resumption_cleanup - Maintenance and cleanup operations

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed in YELLOW Phase
- **ResumptionManager**: Basic manager with snapshot creation and restoration
- **WorkflowSnapshot**: Captures graph ID, state, position, partial results
- **ResumptionPoint**: Tracks node ID, state version, timestamp, metadata
- **ExecutionEngine Integration**:
  - `execute_until()` - Suspend at specific nodes
  - `resume_from()` - Resume from snapshots
  - `ExecutionStatus::Suspended` variant added

### Remaining Work
- **GREEN Phase**: Checkpoint integration for persistence
- **Error Recovery**: Advanced error handling and retry logic
- **Partial Results**: Better aggregation and tracking
- **Performance**: Optimization for large workflows

## Notes
- Works with interrupt system (HIL-001) âœ“
- Integrates with breakpoint system (HIL-002) âœ“
- Compatible with state inspection (HIL-003) âœ“
- Supports feedback-driven resumption (HIL-004) âœ“
- Ready for long-running workflows (needs checkpoint persistence)
