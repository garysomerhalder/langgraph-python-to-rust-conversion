# TEST-001: Comprehensive Integration Tests

## Status
ðŸ”´ TODO

## Category
Testing

## Priority
P0

## Description
Create comprehensive integration tests that validate the entire LangGraph Rust implementation with real-world workflows.

## Objectives
1. **End-to-End Graph Execution Tests**
   - Test complete graph workflows from start to finish
   - Validate state transitions and transformations
   - Test conditional routing and branching

2. **State Management Integration**
   - Test state persistence across nodes
   - Validate reducers and state merging
   - Test concurrent state updates

3. **Streaming Integration Tests**
   - Test streaming graph execution
   - Validate channel communication between nodes
   - Test backpressure and flow control

4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Test error propagation through graph
   - Validate recovery mechanisms
   - Test timeout and cancellation scenarios

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark graph execution performance
   - Test scalability with large graphs
   - Validate memory usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create test workflows that mirror real LangGraph Python examples
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Code coverage > 80% for core modules
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- [ ] CI pipeline integration ready
