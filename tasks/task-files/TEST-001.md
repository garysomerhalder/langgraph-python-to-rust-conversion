# TEST-001: Comprehensive Integration Tests

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ DONE

## Category
Testing

## Priority
P0

## Description
Create comprehensive integration tests that validate the entire LangGraph Rust implementation with real-world workflows.

## Objectives
1. **End-to-End Graph Execution Tests**
   - Test complete graph workflows from start to finish
   - Validate state transitions and transformations
   - Test conditional routing and branching

2. **State Management Integration**
   - Test state persistence across nodes
   - Validate reducers and state merging
   - Test concurrent state updates

3. **Streaming Integration Tests**
   - Test streaming graph execution
   - Validate channel communication between nodes
   - Test backpressure and flow control

4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Test error propagation through graph
   - Validate recovery mechanisms
   - Test timeout and cancellation scenarios

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark graph execution performance
   - Test scalability with large graphs
   - Validate memory usage patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create test workflows that mirror real LangGraph Python examples
- [x] All integration tests pass consistently
- [x] Code coverage > 80% for core modules
- [x] Performance benchmarks documented
- [x] Edge cases and error scenarios covered
- [x] CI pipeline integration ready

## Technical Notes
- Focus on Integration-First testing methodology
- Use real graph configurations, not mocks
- Include async/concurrent execution tests
- Add property-based tests where applicable

## Implementation Summary
Created comprehensive integration tests covering:
- Complete workflow execution with realistic graphs
- State persistence and checkpointing
- Parallel execution patterns
- Streaming with backpressure
- Error handling and recovery
- Channel-based communication
- Flow control mechanisms (rate limiting, circuit breaking)
- Large graph scalability (100+ nodes)
- Concurrent state updates
- Graph validation

All 11 integration tests passing successfully.
