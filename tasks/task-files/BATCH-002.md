# BATCH-002: Parallel Batch Processing

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** BATCH-002
**Title:** Parallel batch processing with advanced scheduling
**Status:** 🔴 IN_PROGRESS - RED PHASE (Writing Failing Tests)
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Batch Processing
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features
**Started:** 2025-09-27 17:25:00 UTC

## 🎯 Objective
Implement advanced parallel processing capabilities for batch jobs with intelligent scheduling, load balancing, and resource optimization.

## 📝 Description
Parallel batch processing enables:
- Multi-threaded job execution with work stealing
- Intelligent job scheduling based on priority and dependencies
- Dynamic load balancing across available resources
- Job dependency management and ordering
- Resource pool management for optimal utilization
- Fair scheduling and anti-starvation mechanisms

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Work-stealing job scheduler implementation
- [ ] Priority-based job queue with dependency resolution
- [ ] Dynamic worker pool scaling
- [ ] Load balancing across worker threads
- [ ] Job dependency graph resolution
- [ ] Resource monitoring and throttling
- [ ] Fair scheduling algorithms
- [ ] Performance metrics and monitoring

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/scheduler.rs
pub struct ParallelScheduler {
    worker_pool: WorkerPool,
    job_queue: PriorityQueue<BatchJob>,
    dependency_graph: DependencyGraph,
    load_balancer: LoadBalancer,
}

pub struct WorkerPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    work_queue: WorkStealingQueue<BatchJob>,
    metrics: WorkerMetrics,
}

pub struct DependencyGraph {
    nodes: HashMap<String, JobNode>,
    edges: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Work Stealing Scheduler**
   - Per-worker local queues
   - Work stealing between idle workers
   - Priority-aware task distribution

2. **Dependency Management**
   - DAG-based job dependencies
   - Automatic dependency resolution
   - Circular dependency detection

3. **Load Balancing**
   - CPU and memory-aware scheduling
   - Dynamic worker allocation
   - Predictive load estimation

4. **Resource Optimization**
   - Worker pool auto-scaling
   - Memory pressure handling
   - CPU throttling for system stability

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for parallel scheduling scenarios
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Basic work-stealing implementation
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced scheduling and optimization

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: BATCH-001 (Batch execution API)
- Related to: BATCH-003 (Result aggregation)
- Related to: BATCH-004 (Error handling)

## 📝 Notes
- Use tokio for async execution with thread pool
- Implement proper backpressure mechanisms
- Consider NUMA topology for worker placement
- Use lockless data structures where possible
