## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/scheduler.rs
pub struct ParallelScheduler {
    worker_pool: WorkerPool,
    job_queue: PriorityQueue<BatchJob>,
    dependency_graph: DependencyGraph,
    load_balancer: LoadBalancer,
}

pub struct WorkerPool {
    workers: Vec<Worker>,
    work_queue: WorkStealingQueue<BatchJob>,
    metrics: WorkerMetrics,
}

pub struct DependencyGraph {
    nodes: HashMap<String, JobNode>,
    edges: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Work Stealing Scheduler**
   - Per-worker local queues
   - Work stealing between idle workers
   - Priority-aware task distribution

2. **Dependency Management**
   - DAG-based job dependencies
   - Automatic dependency resolution
   - Circular dependency detection

3. **Load Balancing**
   - CPU and memory-aware scheduling
   - Dynamic worker allocation
   - Predictive load estimation

4. **Resource Optimization**
   - Worker pool auto-scaling
   - Memory pressure handling
   - CPU throttling for system stability

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for parallel scheduling scenarios ✅ COMPLETE
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Basic work-stealing implementation ✅ COMPLETE
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced scheduling and optimization 🔄 READY

## 🎯 YELLOW Phase Summary (COMPLETE)
**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ Created `ParallelScheduler` with async job distribution
- ✅ Implemented priority-based scheduling with job sorting
- ✅ Built `DependencyResolver` with topological sort and cycle detection
- ✅ Added `WorkerPool` with metrics tracking and simulated auto-scaling
- ✅ Created comprehensive error handling with `SchedulingError` enum
- ✅ Integrated with existing `ExecutionEngine` for real job execution
- ✅ Added 6 comprehensive integration tests (all passing)

**Key Features Working:**
- Parallel job execution using Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Priority scheduling with job queue ordering
- Dependency resolution with DAG validation and cycle detection
- Basic load balancing through parallel execution
- Worker pool metrics with utilization and scaling simulation
- Circular dependency detection with descriptive error messages
- Interior mutability for thread-safe metrics updates

**Test Coverage:**
- Work-stealing scheduler simulation (4 workers, 10 jobs)
- Priority-based job scheduling (3 priority levels)
- Job dependency resolution with topological ordering
- Load balancing across multiple workers
- Worker pool auto-scaling metrics
- Circular dependency detection and error handling

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: BATCH-001 (Batch execution API)
- Related to: BATCH-003 (Result aggregation)
- Related to: BATCH-004 (Error handling)

## 📝 Notes
- Use tokio for async execution with thread pool
- Implement proper backpressure mechanisms
- Consider NUMA topology for worker placement
- Use lockless data structures where possible
