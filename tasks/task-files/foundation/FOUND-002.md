# FOUND-002: Research LangGraph Python Implementation

## 📋 Task Details
- **ID**: FOUND-002
- **Title**: Research LangGraph Python Implementation
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Category**: Foundation
- **Effort**: 2 hours

## 📝 Description
Thoroughly research and document the LangGraph Python implementation to understand its architecture, core features, and API surface. This research will inform the Rust implementation design.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document LangGraph's core concepts and terminology
- [ ] Map out the main classes and their relationships
- [ ] Identify key algorithms and data structures
- [ ] Document the public API surface
- [ ] Note Python-specific features that need Rust alternatives
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Document findings in docs/langgraph-analysis.md

## 🔗 Dependencies
- FOUND-001 (project setup needed for docs structure)

## 📊 Technical Approach
1. Use context7 MCP to research LangGraph documentation
2. Analyze the Python source code structure
3. Identify core abstractions (Graph, Node, Edge, State)
4. Document execution flow and state management
5. Note integration points and extension mechanisms
