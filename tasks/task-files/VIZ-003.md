# VIZ-003: State Inspector UI

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** VIZ-003
**Title:** Interactive state inspector UI for runtime debugging
**Status:** 🔴 TODO
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Category:** Visualization
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive state inspector UI that provides real-time visibility into workflow state, allows interactive state modification, and supports advanced debugging scenarios during development and testing.

## 📝 Description
State inspector UI enables:
- Real-time state monitoring during execution
- Interactive state editing and manipulation
- Multi-level state exploration (channels, values, metadata)
- State history and change tracking
- Breakpoint integration for state inspection
- State export/import for testing scenarios
- Schema validation and type information display

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time state tree visualization with live updates
- [ ] Interactive state editing with validation
- [ ] Multi-channel state view (LastValue, Topic, Context)
- [ ] State change history with diff visualization
- [ ] Breakpoint integration for pause-and-inspect
- [ ] State export/import functionality (JSON, YAML)
- [ ] Schema information display and validation
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities across state data

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/visualization/state_inspector.rs
pub struct StateInspector {
    state_monitor: StateMonitor,
    editor: StateEditor,
    history: StateHistory,
    validator: StateValidator,
}

pub struct StateMonitor {
    active_states: HashMap<String, StateView>,
    update_subscribers: Vec<StateUpdateCallback>,
    change_tracker: ChangeTracker,
}

pub struct StateView {
    channels: HashMap<String, ChannelView>,
    metadata: StateMetadata,
    last_updated: DateTime<Utc>,
    change_summary: ChangeSummary,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **State Tree Visualization**
   - Hierarchical tree view of state structure
   - Expandable/collapsible nodes
   - Type information and schema display
   - Visual indicators for recent changes

2. **Interactive Editing**
   - In-place value editing with validation
   - Type-aware input controls
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Batch edit operations

3. **Change Tracking**
   - Real-time change highlighting
   - Change history timeline
   - Diff visualization with before/after
   - Change impact analysis

4. **Integration Features**
   - Breakpoint pause-and-inspect
   - State snapshot capture
   - Test data generation
   - State comparison tools

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for state monitoring and basic display
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Core tree view and basic editing functionality
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced features, history, and integrations

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: GraphState and advanced channels implementation
- Depends on: Breakpoint system from HIL features
- Related to: VIZ-002 (Execution trace viewer)
- Related to: Schema validation system

## 📝 Notes
- Consider using existing tree view components or libraries
- Accessibility support for keyboard navigation
- Performance optimization for large state objects
- Security considerations for production state access
