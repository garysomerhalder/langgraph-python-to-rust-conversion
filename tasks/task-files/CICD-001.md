# CICD-001: Implement CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** CICD-001
**Title:** Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - Cannot start until EMERGENCY-001 compilation fixed
**Created:** 2025-09-30
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Required to prevent future breaks)
**Category:** DevOps & Process
**Estimated Days:** 3-5 days
**Phase:** Emergency Process Establishment

## 🎯 Objective
Implement robust CI/CD pipeline with quality gates to prevent broken code from reaching main branch and ensure sustainable development practices based on DevOps Agent findings.

## 🚨 DevOps Agent Critical Findings
**Current State:** No CI/CD pipeline, no quality gates, manual processes
- **NO AUTOMATED BUILD/TEST/DEPLOY** - All processes manual
- **NO QUALITY GATES** - Broken code can be merged (BATCH-004 example)
- **NO MONITORING** - No operational metrics or health checks
- **NO DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY** - Missing containerization, K8s configs
- **NO ROLLBACK CAPABILITY** - No automated recovery from failures

## 🔧 CI/CD IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Basic CI Pipeline (Immediate - P0)
**Purpose:** Prevent compilation breaks and test failures from merging
**Platform:** GitHub Actions (already in GitHub repo)

**Pipeline Stages:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, feature/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
          components: rustfmt, clippy

      # CRITICAL: Compilation must pass
      - name: Check compilation
        run: cargo check --all-features --all-targets

      # CRITICAL: No warnings allowed (configurable threshold)
      - name: Lint check
        run: cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings

      # CRITICAL: Code formatting enforced
      - name: Format check
        run: cargo fmt --all -- --check

      # CRITICAL: All tests must pass
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --all-features

      # PERFORMANCE: Benchmarks as regression check
      - name: Run benchmarks
        run: cargo bench --no-run  # Compile only, fast check
```

### 2. Quality Gates Configuration
**Purpose:** Enforce quality standards automatically

**Compilation Gate:**
- **REQUIREMENT:** Zero compilation errors
- **ACTION:** Block merge if compilation fails
- **EXCEPTION:** None allowed

**Warning Gate:**
- **REQUIREMENT:** Maximum 5 warnings (configurable)
- **ACTION:** Block merge if threshold exceeded
- **CURRENT:** 67 warnings → must fix systematically

**Test Gate:**
- **REQUIREMENT:** 100% test pass rate
- **ACTION:** Block merge if any test fails
- **COVERAGE:** Minimum 80% coverage (future goal)

**Security Gate:**
- **REQUIREMENT:** No critical vulnerabilities
- **ACTION:** Run `cargo audit` and block on critical issues
- **DEPENDENCIES:** Check for known vulnerabilities

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks (Developer Experience)
**Purpose:** Catch issues before CI runs

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit

# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: cargo-check
        name: Cargo Check
        entry: cargo check --all-features
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        pass_filenames: false

      - id: cargo-fmt
        name: Cargo Format
        entry: cargo fmt --all --
        language: system
        types: [rust]

      - id: cargo-clippy
        name: Cargo Clippy
        entry: cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        pass_filenames: false
```

### 4. Branch Protection Rules
**Purpose:** Enforce quality gates at repository level

**Main Branch Protection:**
- **Require PR reviews:** 1 reviewer minimum
- **Require status checks:** All CI jobs must pass
- **Require up-to-date branches:** Force rebase before merge
- **Restrict force pushes:** Prevent history rewriting
- **Require signed commits:** Security best practice

### 5. Automated Deployment Pipeline
**Purpose:** Safe, reproducible deployments

**Container Build:**
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile (multi-stage for optimization)
FROM rust:1.75 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
COPY src ./src
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/langgraph-rust /usr/local/bin/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["langgraph-rust"]
```

**Deployment Stages:**
1. **Build & Test:** Create optimized container
2. **Security Scan:** Container vulnerability scanning
3. **Staging Deploy:** Automated deployment to staging
4. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end testing
5. **Production Deploy:** Manual approval required

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
**Purpose:** Operational visibility and alerting

**Health Checks:**
```rust
// Add to main application
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Health check endpoint
    let health_route = warp::path("health")
        .map(|| warp::reply::with_status("OK", warp::http::StatusCode::OK));

    // Metrics endpoint
    let metrics_route = warp::path("metrics")
        .map(|| prometheus::gather().to_string());
}
```

**Metrics Collection:**
- Application performance metrics
- Build/deployment success rates
- Test execution times
- Error rates and types

## 📝 Implementation Notes
This CI/CD implementation is designed to prevent the BATCH-004 disaster from recurring. The DevOps Agent identified that process failures are as dangerous as technical failures. This pipeline ensures that quality is built into the development process, not added as an afterthought.

**Key Principle:** No broken code reaches main branch, ever. Quality is enforced automatically, not hoped for manually.
