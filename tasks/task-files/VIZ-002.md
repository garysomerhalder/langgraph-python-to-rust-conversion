# VIZ-002: Execution Trace Viewer

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** VIZ-002
**Title:** Execution trace viewer for workflow debugging
**Status:** 🔴 TODO
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Category:** Visualization
**Estimated Days:** 3
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement an interactive execution trace viewer that allows developers to visualize, analyze, and debug workflow executions with detailed step-by-step traces, state changes, and performance metrics.

## 📝 Description
Execution trace viewer enables:
- Step-by-step execution visualization
- State diff viewing between execution steps
- Performance timeline with bottleneck identification
- Error highlighting and debugging information
- Interactive replay of workflow executions
- Timeline scrubbing and jump-to-step navigation
- Export of execution traces for analysis

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timeline-based execution visualization
- [ ] State diff viewer with before/after comparison
- [ ] Performance metrics overlay (timing, memory usage)
- [ ] Error highlighting and stack trace integration
- [ ] Interactive replay with play/pause/step controls
- [ ] Search and filter functionality for trace events
- [ ] Export capabilities (JSON, HTML reports)
- [ ] Integration with debugging tools and IDEs

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/visualization/trace_viewer.rs
pub struct TraceViewer {
    trace_data: ExecutionTrace,
    timeline: Timeline,
    state_viewer: StateViewer,
    performance_analyzer: PerformanceAnalyzer,
}

pub struct ExecutionTrace {
    events: Vec<TraceEvent>,
    execution_id: String,
    start_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    duration: Duration,
    metadata: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

pub struct TraceEvent {
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    event_type: EventType,
    node_id: String,
    state_before: Option<StateSnapshot>,
    state_after: Option<StateSnapshot>,
    performance_data: PerformanceData,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Timeline Visualization**
   - Horizontal timeline with execution events
   - Zoom and pan for long executions
   - Minimap for navigation overview
   - Event filtering and grouping

2. **State Inspection**
   - Side-by-side state comparison
   - JSON tree viewer with collapsible nodes
   - Highlighting of changed values
   - State value search and filtering

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Execution time heatmap
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Performance regression detection

4. **Interactive Controls**
   - Play/pause/step execution replay
   - Jump to specific events or timestamps
   - Bookmark important execution points
   - Annotation and commenting system

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for trace data collection and basic viewing
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Core timeline and state viewer implementation
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced analysis features and export capabilities

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: ExecutionEngine tracing capabilities
- Depends on: VIZ-001 (Graph visualization for context)
- Related to: VIZ-003 (State inspector UI)
- Related to: VIZ-004 (Performance profiler)

## 📝 Notes
- Integration with existing tracing infrastructure (OpenTelemetry)
- Consider using existing trace viewers as inspiration (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Efficient handling of large trace files
- Privacy considerations for sensitive state data
