## üéØ Objective
Implement distributed state synchronization to enable multiple LangGraph instances to share and coordinate checkpoint state across a cluster, ensuring consistency and fault tolerance in distributed deployments.

## üìù Description
Distributed state synchronization enables:
- Multi-node LangGraph deployments
- Consistent state across cluster instances
- Leader election and coordination
- Conflict resolution and consensus
- Event-driven state propagation
- Distributed locking mechanisms
- Cross-instance checkpoint sharing

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Distributed checkpointer trait with consensus support
- [ ] Leader election using distributed consensus (Raft/etcd)
- [ ] State synchronization protocol between nodes
- [ ] Conflict resolution with vector clocks/CRDT
- [ ] Distributed locking for critical operations
- [ ] Event-driven state propagation (pub/sub)
- [ ] Node discovery and health monitoring
- [ ] Partition tolerance and split-brain prevention
- [ ] Comprehensive integration tests with multi-node scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for synchronization overhead

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```toml
etcd-rs = "2.0"                    # etcd client for coordination
tokio-broadcast = "0.2"            # Event broadcasting
raft = "0.7"                       # Raft consensus algorithm
dashmap = "6.1"                    # Concurrent state storage
uuid = "1.18"                      # Node identification
chrono = "0.4"                     # Timestamp management
```

### Core Components to Implement
```rust
// src/checkpoint/distributed.rs
pub struct DistributedCheckpointer {
    node_id: String,
    etcd_client: etcd_rs::Client,
    local_checkpointer: Box<dyn Checkpointer>,
    event_bus: tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<StateEvent>,
    consensus: ConsensusEngine,
    lock_manager: DistributedLockManager,
}

pub struct ConsensusEngine {
    raft_node: raft::RawNode,
    cluster_members: HashMap<String, NodeInfo>,
    leader_id: Option<String>,
}

pub struct DistributedLockManager {
    etcd_client: etcd_rs::Client,
    lock_prefix: String,
    lease_ttl: Duration,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum StateEvent {
    CheckpointSaved { thread_id: String, checkpoint_id: String, node_id: String },
    CheckpointDeleted { thread_id: String, checkpoint_id: String, node_id: String },
    NodeJoined { node_id: String, node_info: NodeInfo },
    NodeLeft { node_id: String },
    LeaderChanged { old_leader: Option<String>, new_leader: String },
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Consensus Protocol**
   - Raft-based leader election
   - Cluster membership management
   - Log replication for state changes
   - Split-brain prevention

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Vector clock timestamps
   - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
   - Merge strategies for concurrent updates
   - Event-driven propagation

3. **Distributed Locking**
   - etcd-based distributed locks
   - Lease management with TTL
   - Deadlock detection and prevention
   - Fair lock acquisition

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Async event processing
   - Batch synchronization
   - Local caching with TTL
   - Compression for network efficiency

5. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Network partition handling
   - Node failure detection
   - Automatic failover
   - State recovery mechanisms

## üìä Implementation Plan
1. üî¥ **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for distributed scenarios
2. üü° **YELLOW Phase**: Minimal distributed sync implementation
3. üü¢ **GREEN Phase**: Production hardening with fault tolerance

## üîó Dependencies
- Depends on: All persistence backends (PERSIST-001, PERSIST-002, PERSIST-003)
- Enables: CLOUD-001 (Container/Docker support) and CLOUD-002 (Kubernetes operators)
- Related to: PERSIST-005 (Backup system benefits from distributed state)

## üìù Notes
- Use etcd for coordination as it's widely deployed in Kubernetes
- Implement vector clocks for conflict resolution
- Consider CRDTs for natural conflict resolution
- Test with network partitions and Byzantine failures
- Benchmark synchronization overhead vs. consistency guarantees
- Support for heterogeneous persistence backends across nodes
