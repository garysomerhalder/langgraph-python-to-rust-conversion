# CORE-002: Implement State Management System

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID**: CORE-002  
**Title**: Implement State Management System  
**Status**: 🟢 DONE  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Category**: Core  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Started**: 2025-09-15  
**Completed**: 2025-09-15  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement state management system for graph execution
- Create StateGraph structure for stateful graph execution
- Implement state update and merge strategies
- Add support for conditional edges based on state
- Create state persistence mechanisms

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StateGraph struct implemented with generic state type
- [ ] State channels for concurrent state updates
- [ ] Reducer functions for state merging
- [ ] Conditional edge evaluation based on state
- [ ] State snapshot and restore capabilities
- [ ] Thread-safe state operations
- [ ] All tests passing for state management

## 🔄 Dependencies
- **Depends On**: CORE-001 (Graph Data Structures) ✅
- **Blocks**: CORE-003 (Execution Engine)

## 💡 Technical Notes
- Use tokio channels for async state updates
- Implement Default and Clone for state types
- Consider using Arc<RwLock<T>> for shared state
- Support both sync and async state reducers

## 📊 Progress Log
- [x] Create StateGraph structure
- [x] Implement state channels
