# PERSIST-003: S3/Cloud Storage Backend

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** PERSIST-003
**Title:** S3/Cloud storage backend for persistence
**Status:** 🟡 IN_PROGRESS - YELLOW PHASE COMPLETE
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Category:** Enhanced Persistence
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features
**Start Time:** 2025-09-26 19:00:00 UTC
**Yellow Complete:** 2025-09-26 20:45:00 UTC

## 🎯 Objective
Implement S3/Cloud storage backend for scalable, durable state persistence with unlimited capacity and global availability.

## 📝 Description
S3 backend enables:
- Unlimited storage capacity
- Global availability and durability
- Cost-effective long-term storage
- Versioning and lifecycle management
- Cross-region replication
- Event-driven processing
- CloudFront CDN integration

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Full Checkpointer trait implementation for S3
- [x] AWS SDK integration with aws-sdk
- [x] Support for S3-compatible APIs (MinIO, etc.)
- [x] Efficient serialization with compression
- [x] Multipart upload for large states
- [x] Versioning support
- [x] Lifecycle policies for auto-deletion
- [x] Signed URL generation for direct access
- [ ] Comprehensive integration tests (awaiting real S3/LocalStack)
- [ ] LocalStack-based test environment (needs setup)

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```toml
aws-sdk-s3 = "1.55"
aws-config = "1.5"
aws-types = "1.3"
```

### Core Components to Implement
```rust
// src/checkpoint/s3.rs
pub struct S3Checkpointer {
    client: aws_sdk_s3::Client,
    config: S3Config,
}

pub struct S3Config {
    pub bucket_name: String,
    pub region: String,
    pub key_prefix: String,
    pub enable_versioning: bool,
    pub enable_encryption: bool,
    pub compression: bool,
    pub multipart_threshold_mb: u64,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Storage Operations**
   - PUT/GET objects
   - Multipart upload
   - Batch operations
   - Copy/Move operations

2. **Management Features**
   - Versioning
   - Lifecycle policies
   - Cross-region replication
   - Event notifications

3. **Performance**
   - Compression (gzip/zstd)
   - Parallel uploads
   - CDN integration
   - Transfer acceleration

4. **Security**
   - Server-side encryption
   - Client-side encryption
   - Signed URLs
   - IAM policies

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. ✅ **RED Phase**: Write failing integration tests (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ **YELLOW Phase**: Minimal S3 implementation (COMPLETE)
3. 🔄 **GREEN Phase**: Production hardening (TODO - needs retry logic, better error handling)

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: Checkpointer trait (COMPLETE)
- Related to: PERSIST-005 (Backup system)

## 📝 Notes
- Use AWS SDK v2 for better async support
- Consider S3 Transfer Acceleration for global users
- Implement intelligent tiering for cost optimization
- Add CloudWatch metrics integration
