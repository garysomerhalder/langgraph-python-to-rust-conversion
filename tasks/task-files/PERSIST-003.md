- ✅ Metrics integration ready for CloudWatch/Prometheus

## 🚀 Production Features Implemented

### Core Resilience
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures with configurable thresholds
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for fault tolerance
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for all operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection management

### Observability & Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: Operation counters, timing, circuit breaker state
- **Structured Logging**: Tracing integration with operation context
- **Performance Tracking**: Bytes transferred, operation duration
- **Error Categorization**: Detailed error tracking and aggregation

### Advanced Features
- **Multipart Upload**: Efficient handling of large checkpoint states
- **Compression**: Configurable gzip compression for storage optimization
- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption with AES-256
- **Versioning**: S3 object versioning for checkpoint history
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated archival and deletion
- **Signed URLs**: Direct access URLs for secure sharing
- **Batch Operations**: Parallel save/delete for multiple checkpoints

### Configuration Options
```rust
pub struct S3Config {
    // Basic configuration
    pub bucket_name: String,
    pub region: String,
    pub key_prefix: String,

    // Feature toggles
