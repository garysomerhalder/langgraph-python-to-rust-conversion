# FIX-002: Implement Missing MemoryCheckpointer

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** FIX-002
**Title:** Implement MemoryCheckpointer (completely missing)
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Priority:** P0 (Blocking tests)
**Category:** Critical Fixes
**Estimated Days:** 1
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Emergency Fixes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
**THIS COMPONENT IS REFERENCED EVERYWHERE BUT DOESN'T EXIST**
- Tests import `MemoryCheckpointer` but it's not defined anywhere
- Multiple test files fail to compile because of this
- It's supposed to be in `checkpoint` module but isn't there

## 🎯 Objective
Create the MemoryCheckpointer that should have existed from the beginning.

## 📝 The Problem

### What Tests Expect
```rust
use langgraph::checkpoint::MemoryCheckpointer;

let checkpointer = MemoryCheckpointer::new();
checkpointer.save("checkpoint_1", &state).await?;
let restored = checkpointer.load("checkpoint_1").await?;
```

### What Actually Exists
```rust
// src/checkpoint/mod.rs
pub trait Checkpointer {
    // trait definition exists
}

// But NO MemoryCheckpointer implementation!
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MemoryCheckpointer struct exists in checkpoint module
- [ ] Implements Checkpointer trait properly
- [ ] Can save states to memory
- [ ] Can load states from memory
- [ ] Can list available checkpoints
- [ ] Thread-safe for concurrent access
- [ ] All tests importing it compile

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Required Implementation
```rust
// src/checkpoint/memory.rs
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::RwLock;

pub struct MemoryCheckpointer {
    checkpoints: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, GraphState>>>,
}

impl MemoryCheckpointer {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            checkpoints: Arc::new(RwLock::new(HashMap::new())),
        }
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl Checkpointer for MemoryCheckpointer {
    async fn save(&self, checkpoint_id: &str, state: &GraphState) -> Result<()> {
        // Real implementation, not stub
    }

    async fn load(&self, checkpoint_id: &str) -> Result<GraphState> {
        // Real implementation, not stub
    }

    async fn list(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>> {
        // Real implementation, not stub
    }

    async fn delete(&self, checkpoint_id: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Real implementation, not stub
    }
}
```

### Module Updates Required
```rust
// src/checkpoint/mod.rs
mod memory;
pub use memory::MemoryCheckpointer; // MUST EXPORT THIS
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't create a stub that returns dummy data
- Don't use unwrap() in the implementation
- Don't forget to make it thread-safe
- Don't skip the trait implementation

## 📊 Files Affected
- `src/checkpoint/mod.rs` - Add module and export
- `src/checkpoint/memory.rs` - Create new file with implementation
- All test files importing MemoryCheckpointer will start compiling

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- `MemoryCheckpointer` can be imported from `langgraph::checkpoint`
- All methods of Checkpointer trait are implemented
- Tests using MemoryCheckpointer compile
- Basic unit test for MemoryCheckpointer passes

## 🔥 Why This is Critical
Tests can't compile without this. It's referenced in:
- workflow_resumption_test.rs
- checkpoint_test.rs (if it exists)
- Multiple integration tests

This is a fundamental missing piece that should have been implemented with the checkpoint system.

## 📝 Notes
This is embarrassing. A core component that's imported everywhere but doesn't exist. This is what happens when you mark tasks as "done" without actually testing them.
