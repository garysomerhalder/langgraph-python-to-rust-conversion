# PERSIST-002: Redis Backend

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** PERSIST-002
**Title:** Redis backend for persistence
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Category:** Enhanced Persistence
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features
**Start Time:** 2025-09-26 18:00:00 UTC
**Completed:** 2025-09-26 19:30:00 UTC

## 🎯 Objective
Implement Redis backend for high-speed state persistence, enabling cache-first architecture, session management, and distributed coordination.

## 📝 Description
Redis backend enables:
- Ultra-fast state access (sub-millisecond)
- Distributed caching across instances
- Session-based state management
- TTL-based automatic cleanup
- Pub/Sub for real-time state updates
- Cluster support for horizontal scaling

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full Checkpointer trait implementation for Redis
- [ ] Connection pooling with redis-rs
- [ ] Support for Redis Cluster
- [ ] JSON serialization with compression
- [ ] TTL management for automatic expiry
- [ ] Pub/Sub for state change notifications
- [ ] Atomic operations with Lua scripts
- [ ] Pipeline support for batch operations
- [ ] Comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Docker-based test environment

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```toml
redis = { version = "0.27", features = ["tokio-comp", "connection-manager", "cluster"] }
```

### Core Components to Implement
```rust
// src/checkpoint/redis.rs
pub struct RedisCheckpointer {
    client: redis::Client,
    connection_manager: ConnectionManager,
    config: RedisConfig,
}

pub struct RedisConfig {
    pub redis_url: String,
    pub pool_size: u32,
    pub default_ttl_secs: u64,
    pub key_prefix: String,
    pub enable_cluster: bool,
    pub compression: bool,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Connection Management**
   - Connection pooling
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Health checks

2. **Data Operations**
   - SET/GET with TTL
   - HSET/HGET for structured data
   - Pipeline for batch operations
   - Lua scripts for atomicity

3. **Distributed Features**
   - Pub/Sub for notifications
   - Redis Cluster support
   - Distributed locks

4. **Performance**
   - Compression for large states
   - Pipeline batching
   - Connection multiplexing

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write failing integration tests
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Minimal Redis implementation
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Production hardening

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: Checkpointer trait (COMPLETE)
- Blocks: Distributed state sync (PERSIST-004)

## 📝 Notes
- Use Redis 7.0+ for best performance
- Consider Redis Stack for JSON support
- Implement circuit breaker for resilience
- Add metrics for monitoring
