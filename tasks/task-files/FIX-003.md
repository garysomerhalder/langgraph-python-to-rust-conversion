# FIX-003: Fix ExecutionEngine Missing Methods

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** FIX-003
**Title:** Fix ExecutionEngine missing and broken methods
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Priority:** P0 (Blocking tests)
**Category:** Critical Fixes
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Emergency Fixes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE
**EXECUTIONENGINE IS MISSING CRITICAL METHODS**
- Methods exist but with wrong signatures
- Some methods are stubs returning dummy data
- Tests expect methods that don't exist

## 🎯 Objective
Fix ExecutionEngine to have all required methods with correct signatures and real implementations.

## 📝 Specific Problems

### Missing/Broken Methods
1. **execute_until** - Exists but doesn't actually stop at target
2. **execute_next_node** - Returns dummy state
3. **start_execution** - Wrong return type
4. **execute_with_checkpointing** - Ignores checkpointer
5. **get_current_state** - Returns empty state
6. **resume_from_node** - Just runs full execution

### What Tests Expect vs Reality
```rust
// Tests expect:
let execution_id = engine.execute_until(graph, input, "checkpoint").await?;
// Reality: Returns Uuid but doesn't stop at checkpoint

// Tests expect:
let state = engine.execute_next_node(&execution_id).await?;
// Reality: Just returns empty state, doesn't advance

// Tests expect:
engine.execute_with_checkpointing(graph, input, checkpointer).await?;
// Reality: Ignores checkpointer completely
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] execute_until actually stops at specified node
- [ ] execute_next_node advances execution by one node
- [ ] get_current_state returns real current state
- [ ] execute_with_checkpointing uses the checkpointer
- [ ] resume_from_node resumes from specific node
- [ ] All method signatures match test expectations

## 🔧 Required Fixes

### Fix execute_until
```rust
pub async fn execute_until(
    &self,
    graph: CompiledGraph,
    input: StateData,
    target_node: &str,
) -> Result<Uuid> {
    // MUST actually stop at target_node
    // Not just run everything
}
```

### Fix execute_next_node
```rust
pub async fn execute_next_node(&self, execution_id: &Uuid) -> Result<StateData> {
    // MUST advance execution by exactly one node
    // Return the actual new state
    // Not just return get_current_state()
}
```

### Fix resume_from_node
```rust
pub async fn resume_from_node(
    &self,
    graph: Arc<CompiledGraph>,
    state: StateData,
    node_id: &str,
) -> Result<StateData> {
    // MUST start from specified node
    // Not just run from beginning
}
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't keep stub implementations
- Don't return dummy/empty data
- Don't ignore parameters (like target_node)
- Don't mark complete until methods actually work

## 📊 Impact
This fixes compilation errors in:
- workflow_resumption_test.rs
- human_in_loop_test.rs
- execution_test.rs (if it exists)
- Most integration tests

## 🎯 Definition of Done
- All ExecutionEngine methods have real implementations
- Methods do what their names suggest
- Test files using these methods compile
- No more "TODO: Implement actual logic" comments

## 🔥 Why This is Critical
ExecutionEngine is the CORE of the system. If it doesn't work properly, nothing works. Current implementation is mostly stubs pretending to be real code.

## 📝 Notes
This is what happens when you implement method signatures just to make things compile, without actually implementing the logic. The entire execution engine is basically fake.
