- [ ] Configurable alerting rules and notifications
- [ ] Multi-tenant dashboard views and permissions
- [ ] SLA tracking and violation alerting
- [ ] Historical data analysis and trending
- [ ] Integration with external monitoring systems
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for on-call access

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/visualization/dashboard.rs
pub struct MonitoringDashboard {
    metric_aggregator: MetricAggregator,
    alert_manager: AlertManager,
    dashboard_engine: DashboardEngine,
    notification_system: NotificationSystem,
}

pub struct SystemHealth {
    overall_status: HealthStatus,
    component_health: HashMap<String, ComponentHealth>,
    active_alerts: Vec<Alert>,
    sla_status: SlaStatus,
}

pub struct DashboardConfig {
    layout: DashboardLayout,
    refresh_interval: Duration,
    data_retention: Duration,
    access_permissions: Permissions,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Metrics**
   - Live metric streaming and updates
   - Customizable metric aggregation
   - Time-series data visualization
   - Real-time performance indicators

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Component health checks
   - Dependency monitoring
   - Service discovery and status
   - Automated health scoring

3. **Alerting System**
   - Rule-based alert generation
   - Multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, webhooks)
   - Alert escalation and routing
   - Alert correlation and deduplication

4. **Dashboard Framework**
   - Drag-and-drop dashboard builder
   - Configurable widgets and charts
   - Role-based access control
   - Dashboard sharing and export

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for metrics collection and basic dashboard
