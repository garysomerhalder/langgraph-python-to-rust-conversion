# CORE-005: Advanced Features Implementation

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ DONE

## Category
Core

## Priority
P1

## Description
Implement advanced LangGraph features including conditional edges, subgraphs, tool integration, and agent capabilities.

## Objectives
1. **Conditional Edges**
   - Implement conditional routing based on state
   - Support complex branching logic
   - Add edge weight and priority support

2. **Subgraphs**
   - Enable nested graph composition
   - Support subgraph state isolation
   - Implement subgraph invocation

3. **Tool Integration**
   - Create tool abstraction layer
   - Support function calling
   - Add tool result handling

4. **Agent Capabilities**
   - Implement agent nodes with reasoning
   - Add memory and context management
   - Support multi-agent collaboration

5. **Advanced State Features**
   - Implement state versioning
   - Add state branching and merging
   - Support state snapshots

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Conditional edges working with complex predicates
- [ ] Subgraphs can be composed and executed
- [ ] Tool integration framework implemented
- [ ] Agent nodes can reason and make decisions
- [ ] State management supports advanced features
- [ ] All features have comprehensive tests

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented all advanced features:
- Conditional edges with priority-based routing
- Subgraph composition with state mappers (passthrough and selective)
- Tool integration framework with registry, function tools, HTTP tools, and tool chains
- Agent capabilities with reasoning strategies (ChainOfThought, ReAct), memory management
- Advanced state features including versioning, branching, snapshots, and diffs
- Comprehensive test suite with 12 passing tests covering all features
