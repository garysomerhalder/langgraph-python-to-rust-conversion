# BATCH-003: Result Aggregation Framework

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** BATCH-003
**Title:** Result aggregation framework for batch processing
**Status:** 🟡 IN_PROGRESS
**Started:** 2025-09-27
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Category:** Batch Processing
**Estimated Days:** 2
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive result aggregation framework that efficiently collects, processes, and stores results from batch job executions with support for streaming and various output formats.

## 📝 Description
Result aggregation enables:
- Streaming result collection from parallel jobs
- Configurable aggregation strategies (merge, reduce, collect)
- Memory-efficient handling of large result sets
- Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.)
- Real-time result streaming to consumers
- Result filtering and transformation pipelines
- Checkpoint-based result persistence

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] StreamingAggregator for real-time result collection
- [ ] Configurable aggregation strategies and reducers
- [ ] Memory-efficient result streaming and buffering
- [ ] Multiple output format support (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- [ ] Result filtering and transformation pipeline
- [ ] Checkpoint-based result persistence
- [ ] Backpressure handling for slow consumers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for large datasets

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/batch/aggregation.rs
pub struct ResultAggregator {
    strategy: AggregationStrategy,
    output_format: OutputFormat,
    buffer_size: usize,
    checkpointer: Option<Box<dyn Checkpointer>>,
}

pub enum AggregationStrategy {
    Collect,                          // Collect all results
    Merge(MergeFunction),            // Custom merge function
    Reduce(ReduceFunction),          // Fold/reduce operation
    Stream(StreamProcessor),         // Stream processing
}

pub struct ResultStream {
    receiver: mpsc::Receiver<BatchResult>,
    aggregator: ResultAggregator,
    consumer: Box<dyn ResultConsumer>,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Streaming Collection**
   - Channel-based result streaming
   - Backpressure-aware collection
   - Memory-bounded buffering

2. **Aggregation Strategies**
   - Simple collection of all results
   - Custom merge and reduce operations
   - Real-time streaming aggregation

3. **Output Formats**
   - JSON for structured data
   - CSV for tabular exports
   - Parquet for analytics workloads
   - Custom format plugins

4. **Result Processing**
   - Filtering based on job status/output
   - Transformation pipelines
   - Schema validation and normalization

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for various aggregation scenarios
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Basic result collection and JSON output
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced aggregation and multiple formats

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: BATCH-001 (Batch execution API)
- Depends on: BATCH-002 (Parallel processing)
- Related to: Checkpointer backends for persistence

## 📝 Notes
- Use serde for serialization across formats
- Implement proper error handling for malformed results
- Consider using Apache Arrow for efficient columnar processing
- Support both sync and async result consumers
