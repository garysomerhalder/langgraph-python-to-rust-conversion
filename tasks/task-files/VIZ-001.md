# VIZ-001: Graph Visualization Engine

## 📋 Task Overview
**ID:** VIZ-001
**Title:** Graph visualization engine for workflow diagrams
**Status:** 🔴 TODO
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Category:** Visualization
**Estimated Days:** 4
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Production Features

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive graph visualization engine that can render LangGraph workflows as interactive diagrams with support for real-time updates, custom styling, and export capabilities.

## 📝 Description
Graph visualization enables:
- Interactive workflow diagram rendering
- Real-time graph updates during execution
- Node and edge customization and styling
- Multiple layout algorithms (hierarchical, force-directed, circular)
- Export to various formats (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- Zoom, pan, and selection interactions
- Integration with web frontends and desktop applications

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core graph rendering engine with canvas/SVG output
- [ ] Multiple layout algorithms implementation
- [ ] Interactive features (zoom, pan, selection, tooltips)
- [ ] Real-time updates for live workflow execution
- [ ] Customizable node and edge styling
- [ ] Export functionality (SVG, PNG, PDF)
- [ ] Web component for browser integration
- [ ] API for programmatic graph generation

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```rust
// src/visualization/graph_renderer.rs
pub struct GraphRenderer {
    layout_engine: Box<dyn LayoutEngine>,
    style_manager: StyleManager,
    export_manager: ExportManager,
    interaction_handler: InteractionHandler,
}

pub trait LayoutEngine {
    fn layout(&self, graph: &CompiledGraph) -> GraphLayout;
    fn update_layout(&mut self, changes: &GraphChanges);
}

pub struct GraphLayout {
    nodes: HashMap<String, NodePosition>,
    edges: Vec<EdgePath>,
    bounds: Rectangle,
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Layout Engines**
   - Hierarchical layout for DAG workflows
   - Force-directed layout for complex graphs
   - Circular layout for cyclic patterns
   - Custom layout algorithm support

2. **Rendering Engine**
   - Canvas-based rendering for performance
   - SVG output for scalability
   - WebGL support for large graphs
   - Efficient incremental updates

3. **Interactivity**
   - Mouse/touch event handling
   - Zoom and pan with smooth animations
   - Node selection and highlighting
   - Contextual tooltips and menus

4. **Styling System**
   - CSS-like styling language
   - Conditional styling based on node state
   - Theme support (light/dark modes)
   - Custom shape and icon support

## 📊 Implementation Plan
1. 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write tests for basic graph rendering
2. 🟡 **YELLOW Phase**: Core rendering with simple layout
3. 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Advanced layouts, interactivity, and export

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Depends on: CompiledGraph structure (COMPLETE)
- Related to: VIZ-002 (Execution trace viewer)
- Related to: VIZ-005 (Real-time monitoring)

## 📝 Notes
- Consider using existing graph libraries (like petgraph) for algorithms
- WebAssembly compilation for browser performance
- Accessibility support for screen readers
- Mobile-responsive design considerations
