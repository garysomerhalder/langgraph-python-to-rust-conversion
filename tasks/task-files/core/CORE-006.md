# CORE-006: Implement Human-in-the-Loop with Interrupt/Resume

## 📋 Task Details
- **ID**: CORE-006
- **Category**: Core
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO

## 📝 Description
Implement Python LangGraph's human-in-the-loop capabilities including the `interrupt()` function, `Command` primitive for resumption, and breakpoint support for pausing graph execution at specific nodes.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `Interrupt` type with context preservation
- [ ] Add `interrupt()` function that can pause execution
- [ ] Implement `Command` primitive with resume, update, and goto capabilities
- [ ] Add `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` node configuration
- [ ] Support dynamic breakpoints based on state conditions
- [ ] Enable nested interrupts within single nodes
- [ ] Add timeout management for interrupt points
- [ ] Full checkpoint integration for pause/resume
- [ ] Tests demonstrating human approval workflows
- [ ] Documentation with usage examples

## 🔧 Technical Approach
```rust
// Core types to implement
pub struct Interrupt {
    pub node_id: String,
    pub state: GraphState,
    pub reason: InterruptReason,
    pub checkpoint_id: String,
}

pub struct Command {
    pub resume: Option<Value>,
    pub update: Option<StateUpdate>,
    pub goto: Option<String>,
}

pub trait InterruptibleExecutor {
    async fn execute_with_interrupts(&self) -> Result<ExecutionResult>;
    async fn resume_from_interrupt(&self, command: Command) -> Result<ExecutionResult>;
}
```
