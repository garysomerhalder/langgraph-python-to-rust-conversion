# CORE-001: Implement Core Graph Data Structures

## 📋 Task Details
- **ID**: CORE-001
- **Title**: Implement Core Graph Data Structures
- **Status**: 🔴 TODO
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Category**: Core
- **Effort**: 4 hours

- **Completed**: -

## 📝 Description
Implement the fundamental graph data structures in Rust that form the backbone of LangGraph. This includes Graph, Node, Edge, and State representations with proper ownership and borrowing semantics.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Graph struct implemented with nodes and edges collections
- [ ] Node struct with id, data, and metadata
- [ ] Edge struct with source, target, and conditions
- [ ] State management with proper lifetime handling
- [ ] Serialization/deserialization support (serde)
- [ ] Builder pattern for graph construction
- [ ] All tests passing with real data structures
- [ ] Documentation for all public APIs

## 🔗 Dependencies
- FOUND-001 (project structure)
- FOUND-002 (understanding of Python implementation)

## 📊 Technical Approach
1. Define trait abstractions for extensibility
2. Implement concrete types with generics
3. Use Arc/Rc for shared ownership where needed
4. Implement builder pattern for ergonomic API
5. Add serde derives for serialization
6. Follow Traffic-Light Development (Red→Yellow→Green)
