# 🔧 CORE-004: Streaming and Channels

## 📋 Task Details
- **ID**: CORE-004
- **Category**: Core
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- **Status**: TODO
- **Started**: -
- **Completed**: -

## 🎯 Objectives
Implement advanced streaming and channel-based communication for the LangGraph Rust execution engine.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement streaming output from graph execution
- [ ] Add channel-based node communication
- [ ] Support backpressure and flow control
- [ ] Create streaming transformers
- [ ] Add streaming aggregators
- [ ] Implement stream filters and mappers
- [ ] Add comprehensive streaming tests
- [ ] Document streaming patterns

## 📝 Implementation Checklist

### Streaming Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `StreamingEngine` trait
- [ ] Implement `StreamOutput<T>` for typed streaming
- [ ] Add `StreamingNode` wrapper for nodes
- [ ] Create `StreamCollector` for aggregation
- [ ] Implement `StreamTransformer` trait

### Channel Communication
- [ ] Design `ChannelRegistry` for named channels
- [ ] Implement `ChannelSender<T>` and `ChannelReceiver<T>`
- [ ] Add channel-based edges in graph
- [ ] Support multiple channel types (broadcast, mpsc, oneshot)
- [ ] Implement channel selectors

### Flow Control
- [ ] Add backpressure mechanisms
- [ ] Implement buffering strategies
