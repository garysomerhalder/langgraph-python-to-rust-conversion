# 📋 Task Tracker - AUDIT-BASED REALITY (2025-10-04)

> **🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE:** This tracker has been completely rewritten based on comprehensive project audit.
>
> **Previous assessments were INCORRECT** - claimed 30-68% complete, but project **DOES NOT COMPILE**.
>
> **See:** `/tasks/AUDIT_2025-10-04.md` for full audit findings.

## 🔥 ACTUAL CURRENT STATUS

- **Project State:** ❌ **BROKEN** - Does not compile
- **Actual Completion:** **15-30%** (structure exists, implementation incomplete)
- **Tests Passing:** **0** (cannot run tests - compilation hangs)
- **Production Ready:** **NO** (not even development-ready)
- **Time to Production:** **8 weeks minimum**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix First)

### 🔴 SHOWSTOPPER: Compilation Hangs
```bash
cargo check --lib  # HANGS indefinitely
cargo build        # HANGS indefinitely
cargo test         # HANGS indefinitely
```

**Root Cause:** Likely circular dependencies or trait ambiguity causing infinite type resolution

**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING ALL WORK

## 📊 HISTORICAL ASSESSMENTS (All Incorrect)

| Document | Claimed % | Reality | Error |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| tracker.md (old) | 65% | 15-30% | +35-50% |
| CRITICAL_PATH.md | 68% | 15-30% | +38-53% |

| AUDIT_2025-10-04.md | 15-30% | ✅ ACCURATE | ✅ Based on testing |

**Why previous estimates were wrong:**
- ❌ Didn't verify compilation works
- ❌ Counted structure as implementation
- ❌ Marked tasks complete without testing
- ❌ Ignored TODO comments in code
- ❌ Ignored disabled features

## 🚦 TRAFFIC-LIGHT DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### RED Phase (Define Contracts)
- ❌ Not started - tests don't compile yet

### YELLOW Phase (Minimal Implementation)
- ❌ Not applicable - RED phase not complete

### GREEN Phase (Production Hardening)
- ❌ Not applicable - YELLOW phase not complete

**Current Gate:** 🔴 **BLOCKED AT COMPILATION**
