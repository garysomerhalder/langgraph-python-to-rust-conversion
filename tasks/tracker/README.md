# ðŸ“‹ Task Management System

## Overview
This directory contains the task tracking system for the LangGraph Python to Rust conversion project.

## Directory Structure
```
/tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ tracker/              # Task management files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tracker.md       # Main task inventory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md        # This file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.md     # Progress metrics (to be created)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archive.md       # Completed tasks >30 days (to be created)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ decisions.md     # Project decisions (to be created)
â””â”€â”€ task-files/          # Implementation files
    â”œâ”€â”€ foundation/      # Setup and infrastructure tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core implementation tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ testing/        # Test-related tasks
    â””â”€â”€ documentation/  # Documentation tasks
```

## Task ID Convention
- FOUND-XXX: Foundation/setup tasks
- CORE-XXX: Core implementation tasks
- TEST-XXX: Testing tasks
- DOCS-XXX: Documentation tasks

## Workflow
1. Tasks are created in tracker.md with status ðŸ”´ TODO
2. When work begins, task file is created in appropriate category
3. Status updated to ðŸŸ¡ IN_PROGRESS
4. Upon completion, status updated to ðŸŸ¢ DONE
5. Tasks older than 30 days moved to archive.md

## Integration-First Mandate
All tasks must follow Integration-First principles:
- NO mocks or fakes
- Real APIs and services only
- Traffic-Light Development (Redâ†’Yellowâ†’Green)
- Commit after EVERY phase
