# 📋 Task Tracker - HONEST REALITY EDITION

## 🔴 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE
**Previous tracker was DELUSIONAL. This is the REAL status.**

## 🎯 ACTUAL Project Status
- **Real Completion**: ~25-35% toward production-ready
- **P0 Blockers**: 3 CRITICAL issues preventing ANY production deployment
- **Security Holes**: NO encryption, NO authentication
- **Distributed Claims**: FALSE - only simulations exist
- **Test Status**: 95/99 passing (4 CRITICAL failures)
- **Time to Production**: 5-7 months of focused work

## 🚨 P0 - SHOWSTOPPER BLOCKERS (MUST FIX FIRST)

| ID | Task | Status | Impact | Est. Days |
|----|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **FIX-006** | Fix 4 failing workflow_resumption tests | 🔴 BROKEN | Core functionality broken | 1-2 |
| **SEC-001** | Implement encryption at rest | 🔴 MISSING | Security violation | 7 |
| **SEC-002** | Add authentication & authorization | 🔴 MISSING | Security violation | 10-14 |

**NOTHING ELSE MATTERS UNTIL THESE ARE FIXED**

## 🔥 P1 - CRITICAL (After P0 Fixed)

| ID | Task | Status | Reality Check | Est. Days |
|----|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **PERSIST-004** | Distributed state sync | 🔴 FAKE | In-memory simulation only, violates Integration-First | 21-28 |
| **PERSIST-005** | Backup & recovery | 🟡 PARTIAL | Works but no encryption, no cloud storage | 7 |
| **OPS-001** | CI/CD pipeline | 🔴 MISSING | No automated testing/deployment | 7 |
| **OPS-002** | Observability backends | 🔴 MISSING | Instrumented but nowhere to send data | 7 |
| **OPS-003** | Docker & Kubernetes | 🔴 MISSING | Can't deploy to production | 7 |

## ⚠️ P2 - IMPORTANT (For Production)

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| **CLOUD-001** | Cloud storage integration | 🔴 TODO | S3/GCS for real deployments |
| **CLOUD-002** | Auto-scaling | 🔴 TODO | Production scalability |
| **PERF-001** | Build optimization | 🔴 TODO | Compilation timeouts reported |
| **DOCS-001** | Honest documentation | 🔴 TODO | Current docs oversell by 40% |

## 💡 P3 - NICE TO HAVE (Defer Until Core Fixed)

All BATCH-* and VIZ-* tasks should be **COMPLETELY IGNORED** until P0/P1 complete.

| Category | Tasks | Status | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Batch Processing** | BATCH-001 to BATCH-004 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Visualization** | VIZ-001 to VIZ-005 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Migration Tools** | MIGRATE-001 to MIGRATE-004 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Developer Experience** | DX-001 to DX-005 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |

## 📊 REAL Completion Status by Component

### ✅ What Actually Works (Single-Node Only)
- **Graph construction**: 90% complete
- **State management**: 75% complete (bugs in resumption)
- **Execution engine**: 80% complete
- **Tool/Agent integration**: 85% complete
- **Basic checkpointing**: 70% complete (resumption broken)

### ❌ What's Broken or Fake
- **Workflow resumption**: BROKEN (4 failing tests)
- **Distributed features**: FAKE (simulation only)
- **Security**: MISSING (no encryption, no auth)
- **Production deployment**: IMPOSSIBLE (no CI/CD, no containers)
- **Observability**: BLIND (no backends)

### 🔴 What Doesn't Exist
- Encryption at rest
- Authentication/authorization
- Real distributed consensus (etcd/raft)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Docker images
- Kubernetes manifests
- Observability backends
- Cloud storage integration
- Production documentation

## 🗺️ Critical Path Dependencies

```
MANDATORY SEQUENCE:

1. FIX-006 (Fix tests) ──┐
2. SEC-001 (Encryption) ──┼─→ [UNBLOCK DEVELOPMENT]
3. SEC-002 (Auth) ────────┘
         ↓
4. OPS-001 (CI/CD) ──────────→ [ENABLE AUTOMATION]
         ↓
5. PERSIST-004 (Real etcd) ──→ [ENABLE DISTRIBUTED]
         ↓
6. PERSIST-005 (Complete backup) → [ENABLE DISASTER RECOVERY]
         ↓
7. OPS-002 (Observability) ──→ [ENABLE MONITORING]
         ↓
8. OPS-003 (Docker/K8s) ─────→ [ENABLE DEPLOYMENT]

   [PRODUCTION READY]
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

### This Week (EMERGENCY)
1. **STOP** all feature development
2. **FIX** the 4 failing tests (FIX-006)
3. **START** encryption implementation (SEC-001)
4. **UPDATE** documentation to be honest

### Next 2 Weeks
1. Complete encryption at rest
2. Implement authentication
3. Set up basic CI/CD

### Next Month
1. Replace PERSIST-004 simulation with real etcd
2. Complete PERSIST-005 with encryption
3. Deploy observability stack

### Next 3 Months
1. Complete all P1 tasks
2. Production hardening
3. Performance optimization
4. Security audit

## ⚠️ Reality Check Violations

The previous tracker violated reality by claiming:

| False Claim | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "48% FULLY IMPLEMENTED" | Many are broken or partial |
| "Phase 1 100% COMPLETE" | 4 critical tests failing |
| "HIL features COMPLETE" | Built on broken foundation |
| "MessageGraph COMPLETE" | Untested with failures |
| "65% complete" | ~25-35% toward production |
| "Production-ready" | 5-7 months away |

## 📈 Realistic Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Requirements |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tests Pass** | Week 1 | Fix FIX-006 |
| **Security Basics** | Week 3 | SEC-001, SEC-002 |
| **CI/CD Running** | Week 4 | OPS-001 |
| **Single-Node Production** | Week 8 | P0 + basic P1 |
| **Distributed Working** | Week 16 | PERSIST-004 real implementation |
| **Production Ready** | Week 20-28 | All P1 + P2 complete |

## 🔴 BLOCKER Status Summary

**CANNOT proceed to production until:**
1. ✅ All 99 tests passing (currently 95/99)
2. ✅ Encryption at rest implemented
3. ✅ Authentication/authorization added
4. ✅ Real distributed consensus (not simulation)
5. ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational
6. ✅ Observability stack deployed
7. ✅ Docker/Kubernetes ready

**Current Status: BLOCKED BY P0 ISSUES**

## 📝 Notes

This tracker represents the **HONEST TRUTH** about the project status. The previous tracker was overselling capabilities by approximately 40%.

**Key Principle**: We follow Integration-First methodology. Simulations and mocks are **NOT** acceptable for claiming features work.

**Remember**:
- Traffic-Light Development requires ALL tests passing for GREEN
- Integration-First means real implementations, not fakes
- Security cannot be deferred in production systems
- Distributed claims require actual distributed properties
