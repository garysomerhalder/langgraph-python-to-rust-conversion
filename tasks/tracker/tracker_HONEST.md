# 📋 Task Tracker - HONEST REALITY EDITION

## 🔴 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE
**Previous tracker was DELUSIONAL. This is the REAL status.**
**UPDATE 2025-10-01 4:30 AM: Actual test runs revealed situation is WORSE than initial audit.**
**UPDATE 2025-10-01 5:00 AM: CATASTROPHIC - Functions are STUBS with TODO comments!**

## 🎯 ACTUAL Project Status
- **Real Completion**: ~10-15% toward production-ready (DOWNGRADED TWICE - functions not implemented)
- **P0 Blockers**: 3 CRITICAL issues but FIX-006 is 8-12 days, not 2-3
- **Security Holes**: NO encryption, NO authentication
- **Distributed Claims**: FALSE - only simulations exist
- **Test Status**: BEYOND CATASTROPHIC - Functions are STUBS returning empty data
- **Time to Production**: 9-12 months (INCREASED - core functions not even written)

## 🚨 P0 - SHOWSTOPPER BLOCKERS (MUST FIX FIRST)

| ID | Task | Status | Impact | Est. Days |
|----|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **FIX-006** | IMPLEMENT checkpoint functions (currently STUBS) | 🔴 NOT IMPLEMENTED | Functions are TODO stubs returning empty data | **8-12** |
| **SEC-001** | Implement encryption at rest | 🔴 MISSING | Security violation | 7 |
| **SEC-002** | Add authentication & authorization | 🔴 MISSING | Security violation | 10-14 |

**NOTHING ELSE MATTERS UNTIL THESE ARE FIXED**
**FIX-006 CATASTROPHE: Not bugs - functions have TODO comments and return empty data!**
- `execute_until()`: Has `// TODO: Implement actual execution logic`
- `get_current_state()`: Returns `StateData::new()` always
- `get_partial_results()`: Returns empty vectors always
- Code admits "For YELLOW phase" but claims production ready!

## 🔥 P1 - CRITICAL (After P0 Fixed)

| ID | Task | Status | Reality Check | Est. Days |
|----|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **PERSIST-004** | Distributed state sync | 🔴 FAKE | In-memory simulation only, violates Integration-First | 21-28 |
| **PERSIST-005** | Backup & recovery | 🟡 PARTIAL | Works but no encryption, no cloud storage | 7 |
| **OPS-001** | CI/CD pipeline | 🔴 MISSING | No automated testing/deployment | 7 |
| **OPS-002** | Observability backends | 🔴 MISSING | Instrumented but nowhere to send data | 7 |
| **OPS-003** | Docker & Kubernetes | 🔴 MISSING | Can't deploy to production | 7 |

## ⚠️ P2 - IMPORTANT (For Production)

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| **CLOUD-001** | Cloud storage integration | 🔴 TODO | S3/GCS for real deployments |
| **CLOUD-002** | Auto-scaling | 🔴 TODO | Production scalability |
| **PERF-001** | Build optimization | 🔴 TODO | Compilation timeouts reported |
| **DOCS-001** | Honest documentation | 🔴 TODO | Current docs oversell by 40% |

## 💡 P3 - NICE TO HAVE (Defer Until Core Fixed)

All BATCH-* and VIZ-* tasks should be **COMPLETELY IGNORED** until P0/P1 complete.

| Category | Tasks | Status | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Batch Processing** | BATCH-001 to BATCH-004 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Visualization** | VIZ-001 to VIZ-005 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Migration Tools** | MIGRATE-001 to MIGRATE-004 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |
| **Developer Experience** | DX-001 to DX-005 | 🔴 TODO | DEFER |

## 📊 REAL Completion Status by Component

### ✅ What Actually Works (Single-Node Only)
- **Graph construction**: 90% complete
- **State management**: 75% complete (bugs in resumption)
- **Execution engine**: 80% complete
- **Tool/Agent integration**: 85% complete
- **Basic checkpointing**: 70% complete (resumption broken)

### ❌ What's Broken or Fake
- **Workflow resumption**: CATASTROPHICALLY BROKEN (5/9 tests failing - 56% failure rate)
  - State capture: BROKEN (snapshot.state empty)
  - Checkpointer integration: BROKEN (checkpoint not found)
  - Completed nodes tracking: BROKEN (not tracked)
  - Cleanup logic: BROKEN (wrong deletion count)
  - History recording: BROKEN (history empty)
- **Distributed features**: FAKE (simulation only)
- **Security**: MISSING (no encryption, no auth)
- **Production deployment**: IMPOSSIBLE (no CI/CD, no containers)
- **Observability**: BLIND (no backends)

### 🔴 What Doesn't Exist
- Encryption at rest
- Authentication/authorization
- Real distributed consensus (etcd/raft)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Docker images
- Kubernetes manifests
- Observability backends
- Cloud storage integration
- Production documentation

## 🗺️ Critical Path Dependencies

2. SEC-001 (Encryption) ──┼─→ [UNBLOCK DEVELOPMENT]
3. SEC-002 (Auth) ────────┘
         ↓
4. OPS-001 (CI/CD) ──────────→ [ENABLE AUTOMATION]

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

### This Week (EMERGENCY)
1. **STOP** all feature development
2. **FIX** the 4 failing tests (FIX-006)
3. **START** encryption implementation (SEC-001)
4. **UPDATE** documentation to be honest

### Next 2 Weeks
1. Complete encryption at rest
2. Implement authentication
3. Set up basic CI/CD

### Next Month
1. Replace PERSIST-004 simulation with real etcd
2. Complete PERSIST-005 with encryption
3. Deploy observability stack

### Next 3 Months
1. Complete all P1 tasks
2. Production hardening
3. Performance optimization
4. Security audit

## ⚠️ Reality Check Violations

The previous tracker violated reality by claiming:

| False Claim | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "48% FULLY IMPLEMENTED" | Many are broken or partial |
| "Phase 1 100% COMPLETE" | 4 critical tests failing |
| "HIL features COMPLETE" | Built on broken foundation |
| "MessageGraph COMPLETE" | Untested with failures |
| "65% complete" | ~25-35% toward production |
| "Production-ready" | 5-7 months away |

## 📈 Realistic Timeline (REVISED AFTER STUB DISCOVERY)

| Milestone | Target Date | Requirements |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Tests Pass** | **Week 2-3** | IMPLEMENT FIX-006 functions from scratch |
| **Security Basics** | **Week 5** | SEC-001, SEC-002 |
| **CI/CD Running** | **Week 6** | OPS-001 |
| **Single-Node Production** | **Week 12** | P0 + basic P1 |
| **Distributed Working** | **Week 24** | PERSIST-004 real implementation |
| **Production Ready** | **Week 36-48** | All P1 + P2 complete |

## 🔴 BLOCKER Status Summary

**CANNOT proceed to production until:**
1. ✅ All tests passing (workflow_resumption: 4/9 passing = 56% FAILURE RATE)
2. ✅ Encryption at rest implemented
3. ✅ Authentication/authorization added
4. ✅ Real distributed consensus (not simulation)
5. ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational
6. ✅ Observability stack deployed
7. ✅ Docker/Kubernetes ready

**Current Status: CATASTROPHICALLY BLOCKED BY P0 ISSUES**
**Previous "99 tests passing" claim was IMPOSSIBLE - project couldn't even compile!**

## 📝 Notes

This tracker represents the **HONEST TRUTH** about the project status. The previous tracker was overselling capabilities by approximately 40%.

**Key Principle**: We follow Integration-First methodology. Simulations and mocks are **NOT** acceptable for claiming features work.

**Remember**:
- Traffic-Light Development requires ALL tests passing for GREEN
- Integration-First means real implementations, not fakes
- Security cannot be deferred in production systems
- Distributed claims require actual distributed properties
