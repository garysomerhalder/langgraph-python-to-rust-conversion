# Task 001: Initialize Workspace

## 📋 Task Details
- **ID**: 001
- **Phase**: 🔴 RED
- **Priority**: P0 (Critical Path)
- **Estimated Hours**: 2
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **Created**: 2024-12-15
- **Updated**: 2024-12-15

## 📝 Description
Initialize the Rust workspace structure for the LangGraph port project. This foundational task sets up the multi-crate architecture that will support modular development and clean separation of concerns.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root Cargo.toml with workspace configuration created
- [ ] Directory structure matches planned architecture
- [ ] All workspace members properly configured
- [ ] Basic README.md with project overview
- [ ] .gitignore configured for Rust development
- [ ] License file (MIT) added
- [ ] Initial Git repository initialized
- [ ] Workspace builds successfully with `cargo build`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Root Cargo.toml
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crates/langgraph-core",
    "crates/langgraph-channels",
    "crates/langgraph-pregel",
    "crates/langgraph-checkpoint",
    "crates/langgraph-runtime",
    "langgraph-py",
]
resolver = "2"

[workspace.package]
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
authors = ["LangGraph Rust Contributors"]
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-rust"

[workspace.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.41", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
thiserror = "2.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
```

## 🔗 Dependencies
- **Blocked By**: None
- **Blocks**: All other tasks
- **Related**: Task 002 (Setup Cargo Workspace)

## 🚦 Traffic-Light Status
- **RED Phase Goal**: Create failing structure that will be filled in
- **Success Metric**: Workspace compiles but has no functionality

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Wrong structure chosen | High | Review Python LangGraph structure first |
| Missing crates | Medium | Can add additional crates later |

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- [ ] `cargo build --workspace` succeeds
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` runs (even with no tests)
- [ ] All crates visible in workspace
- [ ] Documentation builds with `cargo doc`

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Workspace structure matches plan
- All commands execute without errors
- Clean Git repository initialized
- Ready for development

## 📝 Implementation Notes
```bash
# Commands to execute:
mkdir -p langgraph-rust && cd langgraph-rust
cargo init --name langgraph-rust

# Create workspace structure
mkdir -p crates/{langgraph-core,langgraph-channels,langgraph-pregel,langgraph-checkpoint,langgraph-runtime}
mkdir -p {tests,benches,examples,docs,langgraph-py}

# Initialize each crate
for crate in crates/*; do
  cargo init --lib --name $(basename $crate) $crate
done

# Initialize Python bindings crate
cargo init --lib --name langgraph-py langgraph-py

# Update root Cargo.toml with workspace configuration
```

## ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Workspace structure created
- [ ] All crates initialized
- [ ] Cargo.toml configured
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Initial commit made
- [ ] Task marked complete in tracker
- [ ] Next task (002) unblocked
