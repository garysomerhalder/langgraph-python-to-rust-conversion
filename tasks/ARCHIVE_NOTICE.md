## üö® THESE DOCUMENTS ARE OBSOLETE

The following task documents have been **ARCHIVED** and should **NOT** be used for planning or status tracking:

### ‚ùå Archived Documents

1. **CRITICAL_PATH.md (OLD)**
   - **Claimed:** 68% complete
   - **Reality:** 15-30% complete
   - **Error:** +38-53 percentage points
   - **Reason:** Did not verify compilation, counted structure as implementation

2. **ROADMAP_TO_100.md (OLD)**
   - **Claimed:** 30% complete
   - **Reality:** 15-30% complete
   - **Error:** Assumed code compiles (it doesn't)
   - **Reason:** Identified some issues but didn't test compilation

3. **tracker.md (OLD - pre-audit version)**
   - **Claimed:** 65% complete, "ALL compilation errors FIXED"
   - **Reality:** Project hangs during compilation
   - **Error:** +35-50 percentage points
   - **Reason:** Marked tasks complete without verification

4. **`task-files/P1-*.md`** (Foundation tasks)
   - Phase 1: Implement core with Traffic-Light
   - RED/YELLOW/GREEN development

5. **`task-files/P2-*.md`** (Integration tasks)

## üìä WHY PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS WERE WRONG

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Didn't test compilation** | Claimed code worked when it doesn't | "ALL compilation errors FIXED" while cargo check hangs |
| **Counted structure as implementation** | Inflated completion % | 26K lines of code ‚â† working features |
| **Ignored TODO comments** | Missed unimplemented features | 17+ "TODO: Implement actual..." in core code |
| **Disabled features hidden** | Claimed features complete | S3 checkpointer commented out |
| **Tests marked complete without running** | False confidence | Tests disabled via feature flags |

### Lesson Learned

**ALWAYS VERIFY:**
- ‚úÖ Code compiles (`cargo check`)
- ‚úÖ Tests run (`cargo test`)
- ‚úÖ Features work (manual testing)
- ‚úÖ No TODO comments in "complete" code
- ‚úÖ No disabled modules
- ‚úÖ Documentation matches reality

## üéØ WHAT CHANGED

### Old Assessment (Incorrect)
- **Completion:** 30-68%
- **Tests Passing:** 11-99
- **Production Ready:** "Yes" or "In 4-6 weeks"
- **Method:** Code inspection only, no testing

### New Assessment (Correct)
- **Completion:** 15-30%
- **Tests Passing:** 0 (code doesn't compile)
- **Production Ready:** "8 weeks minimum"
- **Method:** Comprehensive audit with compilation testing

### Key Difference
**Old:** Assumed code worked if it existed
**New:** Verified code compiles and runs

## üìã MIGRATION GUIDE

**If you were using old documents:**

1. **Stop** referencing CRITICAL_PATH.md or ROADMAP_TO_100.md
2. **Read** AUDIT_2025-10-04.md for complete findings
3. **Use** tracker/tracker.md for current status
4. **Follow** Phase 0 tasks to fix compilation first
5. **Apply** Traffic-Light Development strictly

**Task Mapping:**

| Old Task | New Task | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| HIL-001 (claimed complete) | P1-RED-003, P1-YEL-003, P1-GRN-* | üî¥ BLOCKED (compilation) |
| PERSIST-001 (claimed in progress) | P2-INT-001, P2-INT-004 | üî¥ BLOCKED (Phase 1) |
| All "complete" tasks | Re-evaluate after Phase 0 | üî¥ BLOCKED |
| All "in progress" tasks | Re-evaluate after Phase 0 | üî¥ BLOCKED |

---

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDER

**NOTHING can proceed until Phase 0 completes:**
- Project does not compile
- Tests cannot run
- No features can be verified

**First priority:** Fix compilation (P0-001 through P0-004)
